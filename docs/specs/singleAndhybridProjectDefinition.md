# Single / Hybrid Project Type Definition

Source: `singleAndhybridProjectDefinietion.md`

## Summary
- Rename Contract Type to Project Type.
- Project Type category:
  - Single: choose one service item.
  - Hybrid: choose multiple service items.
- Hybrid projects present milestones separated by service item/department.
- Project creation requires compliance attachments (Order/SLA; PDF preferred; Word/PNG allowed).

## Core Rules
1) Creating a project type requires binding service items and stage templates.
2) Hybrid projects allow cross-department template combinations.
3) Attachments are required at project creation for compliance.
4) Milestones are generated from selected templates.

## User Flow (High-Level)
- System settings: define project types, service items, and stage templates; configure required attachments.
- Project creation: select project type -> select service items -> upload required attachments -> milestones auto-generated -> assign members.
